    <ol>
      <li>I am trying to reach future employers, to allow this website to represent me when I can’t represent myself.</li>
      <li>I chose to include anything I felt that would please a future employer. I chose works that I was proud of, a get to know me section, and my resume</li>
      <li>Each piece is suppose to say “wow this girl is really on top of her work and I want her to work for us.</li>
      <li>Each of those items express who I am as a worker and it fits right on why a future employer would choose me.</li>
      <li>I have another website project for another class that breaks down my future venture and I need to include that because it breaks down each area of starting my business. It is really impressive to see the effort I put into starting a business and the organization within that.</li>
